    "text": "1 Introduction\nSoccer is the most popular sport globally, with over 2 billion viewers tuning in to the FIFA World Cup Final 2022. Recently, the game has been transformed by the integration of data analytics, reshaping how teams approach strategy. Soccer managers now rely heavily on data analysis to make critical decisions, such as selecting the starting lineup, identifying transfer market targets, and determining in-game substitutions. Additionally, extensive datasets of soccer matches are readily available, enabling deeper insights into the sport.\nThis project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of soccer performance, focusing on key factors and questions that impact outcomes at both the player and team levels. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights by exploring various dynamics within the data.\nOur analysis will examine player performance across consecutive matches, evaluating how individuals sustain or adapt their performance over time while identifying patterns of consistency or decline. Beyond individual performance, we will assess overall team performance, comparing actual outcomes with expected performance to pinpoint teams that are overachieving or underperforming.\nKey elements of the study include analyzing how passing accuracy and assist patterns influence team success, investigating the advantages of playing at home, and assessing the impact of starting lineups and in-game substitutions on match results. The findings will be presented through detailed charts and metrics, offering a clear framework for building the ultimate team.\nBy utilizing data-driven techniques, this project seeks to deliver valuable insights that can help teams optimize their strategies and give fans a deeper understanding of the elements driving success on the soccer field.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur dataset consists of 23 columns, with the number of rows/samples depending on the specific range of match_ids included. For example, in the dataset below, we used match_ids ranging from 1 to 500. It is important to note that match_ids from indexes 1 until 80 are absent. Instead of generating an error when a match_id is missing, we implemented a tryCatch function to handle this scenario gracefully. This function checks if a match_id exists, and if it does not, it inserts a NaN value in the dataset. As a result, any NaN values in our dataset are solely due to missing match_ids; otherwise, the dataset is free of missing values or NaNs. In the case of match_ids 1 to 500, our dataset has a total of 11,654 observations, resulting in a dataset shape of 11,654 rows by 23 columns.\nThe dataset includes the following features along with their descriptions:",

We finalized on World Football Data for R. The research and comparison of the datasets were done collectively by all three members of the group.\nThe website guiding the installation of the dataset and providing the link to the GitHub repository was last updated on November 15, 2024, with a prior update in June 2024. The most recent change to the repository, specifically to the README file, was made 4 days ago. The author appears to update the repository frequently, as indicated by the varying timestamps on different folders and files.\nThe World Football Data repository offers a wide range of datasets, and for this project, we have chosen to work with the player performance data for individual matches. This dataset was last updated 4 months ago. We plan to update the match_ids to a sequential list of match_id values and fetch data for those match_ids. If no data is available for a particular match_id, we will add a row with NaN values. Otherwise, we will add the corresponding match data.\nOne issue we observed is that some of the data in the repository has not been updated recently, with some datasets being as old as 2 years. This is another reason we chose to work with player performance in specific matches, as this data is more recently updated.\nTo fetch data for a single match, we can use the understat_match_players function from the understatr library. Below is a glimpse of how we can fetch data for match ID 14788.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\nwba_liv_players &lt;- understat_match_players(match_url = \"https://understat.com/match/14788\")\n\n\nCombining data for matches with the given match ID:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#match IDs\nmatch_ids &lt;- seq(1, 500)          \nmatch_list &lt;- list()\n\n#column names\nexample_match_url &lt;- \"https://understat.com/match/14788\"\nexample_data &lt;- tryCatch({\n  understat_match_players(match_url = example_match_url)\n}, error = function(e) {\n  data.frame() \n})\ndefault_columns &lt;- names(example_data)\n\n#iterate over match IDs\nfor (id in match_ids) {\n  match_url &lt;- paste0(\"https://understat.com/match/\", id)\n  match_data &lt;- tryCatch({\n    understat_match_players(match_url = match_url)\n  }, error = function(e) {\n    #error handling\n    data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 1, ncol = length(default_columns)),\n               stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %&gt;%\n      setNames(default_columns)\n  })\n\n  match_data$id &lt;- id\n  match_list[[as.character(id)]] &lt;- match_data\n}\n\n#Combine all data into a single data frame\nall_match_players &lt;- bind_rows(match_list)\n\n\nCreating a CSV file of the data:\n\n\nCode\n# write.csv(all_match_players, \"combined_match_players_0-500.csv\", row.names = FALSE)",

    "text": "2.2 Missing Value Analysis\nIn our dataset, missing values are introduced only for incorrect match_id values. For the correct match_id values, there are no missing values, ensuring data completeness. However, when an incorrect match_id is encountered, we add a row with NaN values for all columns except for the id column, which serves as an identifier. This approach allows us to clearly identify and track the rows with invalid match_id values. In total, there are 80 incorrect match_id values in the dataset, resulting in 80 rows where all values are NaN, except for the id.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(naniar)\n\nmissing_values &lt;- all_match_players %&gt;%\n  summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.))) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    everything(), \n    names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"MissingCount\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n  filter(MissingCount &gt; 0)\n\nggplot(missing_values, aes(x = Variable, y = MissingCount)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart of Missing Values by Variable\",\n       x = \"Variable\",\n       y = \"Number of Missing Values\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart depicts that each column in the data has 80 missing values which corresponds to the NaN rows inserted for invalid match ids indicating that the rest of our data (the rows with valid match ids) have no missing values.\n\n\nCode\n# library(ggplot2)\n# library(tidyr)\n# library(dplyr)\n#library(remotes)\n#remotes::install_github(\"jtr13/redav\")\n\nlibrary(redav)\n\ndata_missing &lt;- all_match_players[!complete.cases(all_match_players), ]\nplot_missing(data_missing, max_cols = 8, num_char = 3, percent = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Missing Values Pattern Analysis\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 2, vjust = 48))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot of missing also verifies the same information that the quality of data is good with minimal missing values. There is only 1 missing value pattern observed which we can safely say comes from match IDs from 1 - 80 since they are the NaN rows corresponding to invalid match ids.",
