    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe aim of the project is to perform a comprehensive analysis on soccer performance, delving into key features and questions that would influence outcomes at both the player and team levels. Our primary objective is to discover actionable insights by exploring various dynamics of the data.\nWe are interested to find player performance over consecutive matches, understand how individual players maintain or adapt their performance across successive games and identify patterns of consistency or decline. Broadening this we will also explore overall team performance, including a comparison between actual player performance and expected performance, to identify overachieving or underperforming teams.\nAnalyzing how passing accuracy and assist patterns contribute to a team’s success, studying the home stadium advantage, evaluating effects of starting lineups and in-game substitutions on match outcomes, will all be formalized in numbers and charts. This is your guide to build the dream team!\nBy leveraging data-driven techniques, this project aims to provide nuanced insights that will help teams manage strategies and fans better understand the factors driving success on the soccer field.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nOur dataset consists of 23 columns, with the number of rows/samples depending on the specific range of match_ids included. For example, in the dataset below, we used match_ids ranging from 1 to 500. It is important to note that match_ids from 1 to 80 are absent. Instead of generating an error when a match_id is missing, we implemented a tryCatch function to handle this scenario gracefully. This function checks if a match_id exists, and if it does not, it inserts a NaN value in the dataset. As a result, any NaN values in our dataset are solely due to missing match_ids; otherwise, the dataset is free of missing values or NaNs. In the case of match_ids 1 to 500, our dataset has a total of 11,654 observations, resulting in a dataset shape of 11,654 rows by 23 columns.\nThe dataset includes the following features along with their descriptions:",

We finalised on World Football data for R. The research and comparison for the datasets was done by all three members of the group collectively while compling it was handled by Meyhar.\nThe website guiding with installation of the dataset and providing the link to the git repo has been updated recently (11/15/2024) and prior to that it was updated in June 2024. While the latest update/change in the git has been made as of 4 days ago in the readme file. The author seems to update often enough indicated by the varying time on different folders and files.\nUnder the world football data repo there is a lot of variety of data one can work with for this project we have chosen to work with the player performance in a match. This data was updated 4 months ago. We can update the match_ids to a sequence of match_id values, and we fetch the data for those match ids. If there is no data for that match_id we add a NaN row, or else we add the data of that match.\nOne problem we observed is some of the data has not been recently updated, it is as old as 2 years. Hence another reason for us to choose player performance in a specific match, it is more recently updated.\nA single match’s data can be imported using understat_match_players function of the understatr library. Below is a glimpse of how we can fetch data for match id 14788.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\nwba_liv_players &lt;- understat_match_players(match_url = \"https://understat.com/match/14788\")\n\n\nCombining data for matches with the given match_ids\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Define the match IDs\nmatch_ids &lt;- seq(1, 500)            #Specify the match Ids for which you want to fetch data\nmatch_list &lt;- list()\n\n# Get column names\nexample_match_url &lt;- \"https://understat.com/match/14788\"\nexample_data &lt;- tryCatch({\n  understat_match_players(match_url = example_match_url)\n}, error = function(e) {\n  data.frame() # Return an empty data frame if the example fails\n})\ndefault_columns &lt;- names(example_data)\n\n# Iterate over match IDs\nfor (id in match_ids) {\n  match_url &lt;- paste0(\"https://understat.com/match/\", id)\n  match_data &lt;- tryCatch({\n    # Attempt to fetch match data\n    understat_match_players(match_url = match_url)\n  }, error = function(e) {\n    # Handle errors by creating an NA data frame\n    data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 1, ncol = length(default_columns)),\n               stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %&gt;%\n      setNames(default_columns)\n  })\n\n  # Add match ID to the data\n  match_data$id &lt;- id\n  match_list[[as.character(id)]] &lt;- match_data\n}\n\n#Combine all match data into a single data frame\nall_match_players &lt;- bind_rows(match_list)\n\n\nCreating csv of data\n\n\nCode\n# write.csv(all_match_players, \"combined_match_players_0-500.csv\", row.names = FALSE)",

For the correct match_id values, there are no missing values, ensuring data completeness.

This approach allows us to clearly identify and track the rows with invalid match_id values.
