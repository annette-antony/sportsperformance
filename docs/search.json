    "text": "1 Introduction\nSoccer is the most popular sport globally, with over 2 billion viewers tuning in to the FIFA World Cup Final 2022. Recently, the game has been transformed by the integration of data analytics, reshaping how teams approach strategy. Soccer managers now rely heavily on data analysis to make critical decisions, such as selecting the starting lineup, identifying transfer market targets, and determining in-game substitutions. Additionally, extensive datasets of soccer matches are readily available, enabling deeper insights into the sport.\nThis project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of soccer performance, focusing on key factors and questions that impact outcomes at both the player and team levels. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights by exploring various dynamics within the data.\nOur analysis will examine player performance across consecutive matches, evaluating how individuals sustain or adapt their performance over time while identifying patterns of consistency or decline. Beyond individual performance, we will assess overall team performance, comparing actual outcomes with expected performance to pinpoint teams that are overachieving or underperforming.\nKey elements of the study include analyzing how passing accuracy and assist patterns influence team success, investigating the advantages of playing at home, and assessing the impact of starting lineups and in-game substitutions on match results. The findings will be presented through detailed charts and metrics, offering a clear framework for building the ultimate team.\nBy utilizing data-driven techniques, this project seeks to deliver valuable insights that can help teams optimize their strategies and give fans a deeper understanding of the elements driving success on the soccer field.",

For example, in the dataset below, we used match_ids ranging from 1 to 500. It is important to note that match_ids from indexes 1 until 80 are absent. Instead of generating an error when a match_id is missing, we implemented a tryCatch function to handle this scenario gracefully. This function checks if a match_id exists, and if it does not, it inserts a NaN value in the dataset. As a result, any NaN values in our dataset are solely due to missing match_ids; otherwise, the dataset is free of missing values or NaNs. In the case of match_ids 1 to 500, our dataset has a total of 11,654 observations, resulting in a dataset shape of 11,654 rows by 23 columns.\nThe dataset includes the following features along with their descriptions:",

We finalized on World Football Data for R. The research and comparison of the datasets were done collectively by all three members of the group.\nThe website guiding the installation of the dataset and providing the link to the GitHub repository was last updated on November 15, 2024, with a prior update in June 2024. The most recent change to the repository, specifically to the README file, was made 4 days ago. The author appears to update the repository frequently, as indicated by the varying timestamps on different folders and files.\nThe World Football Data repository offers a wide range of datasets, and for this project, we have chosen to work with the player performance data for individual matches. This dataset was last updated 4 months ago. We plan to update the match_ids to a sequential list of match_id values and fetch data for those match_ids. If no data is available for a particular match_id, we will add a row with NaN values. Otherwise, we will add the corresponding match data.\nOne issue we observed is that some of the data in the repository has not been updated recently, with some datasets being as old as 2 years. This is another reason we chose to work with player performance in specific matches, as this data is more recently updated.\nTo fetch data for a single match, we can use the understat_match_players function from the understatr library. Below is a glimpse of how we can fetch data for match ID 14788.\n\n\nCode\n# library(worldfootballR)\n# wba_liv_players &lt;- understat_match_players(match_url = \"https://understat.com/match/14788\")\n# \n# ```\n# \n# Combining data for matches with the given match ID:\n# \n# ```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\n# library(dplyr)\n# \n# #match IDs\n# match_ids &lt;- seq(1, 500)          \n# match_list &lt;- list()\n# \n# #column names\n# example_match_url &lt;- \"https://understat.com/match/14788\"\n# example_data &lt;- tryCatch({\n#   understat_match_players(match_url = example_match_url)\n# }, error = function(e) {\n#   data.frame() \n# })\n# default_columns &lt;- names(example_data)\n# \n# #iterate over match IDs\n# for (id in match_ids) {\n#   match_url &lt;- paste0(\"https://understat.com/match/\", id)\n#   match_data &lt;- tryCatch({\n#     understat_match_players(match_url = match_url)\n#   }, error = function(e) {\n#     #error handling\n#     data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow = 1, ncol = length(default_columns)),\n#                stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %&gt;%\n#       setNames(default_columns)\n#   })\n# \n#   match_data$id &lt;- id\n#   match_list[[as.character(id)]] &lt;- match_data\n# }\n# \n# #Combine all data into a single data frame\n# all_match_players &lt;- bind_rows(match_list)\n\n\nCreating a CSV file of the data:\n\n\nCode\n# write.csv(all_match_players, \"combined_match_players_0-500.csv\", row.names = FALSE)",

Generally, more important players tend to play more minutes compared to those with lesser roles (though this can be influenced by factors such as injuries). Therefore, by examining the bar graph, we can identify which players are crucial to each team. Players positioned at the top of the bar chart for each team are likely to be the most important.\nThis also allow us to assess which players may be overworked and could potentially benefit from more rest. By analyzing the amount of playing time, we can identify players who are being relied upon heavily, which may indicate a risk of fatigue or injury if not managed properly.\nFor example, Hector Bellerin stands out as one of Arsenal’s most crucial players, as he has accumulated the highest amount of playing time. This suggests that he is a key part of the team’s strategy and is likely being relied upon for consistent performance. Such insights help in understanding player dynamics and can guide decisions related to player rotation and rest to maintain peak performance throughout the season.",

Since goals are the ultimate objective in football, every team aims to maximize both their expected goals and their actual goals. If a team has a high xG but a lower number of goals, it suggests they are not capitalizing on their chances effectively. Conversely, a low xG paired with a high number of goals may indicate efficient finishing.\nThe y = x line represents the line where expected goals are equal to the actual goals across all matches played, ideally every team would like their players to atleast be on this line or above it. Any points falling below the line indicates the actual goals made are lesser than the expected goals. From the graph, we observe that teams like Tottenham Hotspur and Leicester City often have points below the y = x line, reflecting fewer goals than expected. Teams can use these insights to improve their conversion rate. On the other hand, teams like Liverpool and West Ham frequently exceed the y = x line, demonstrating better utilization of their scoring opportunities.",

Indicating they are indeed extremely important for the team, some of these players include Mesut Ozil, Dimitri Payet, James Milner, Adam Lallana etc. However this is not always the case, nearly 50% of these 20 players did not play many minutes on their teams yet they contributed in the short time they were on the field making them critical for game strategies.\nAn interesting observation is that Troy Deeney exactly as many assists as expected.

All teams, except Bournemouth, Hull City, Leicester City, Sunderland, and Swansea City, show higher xG per match when playing at home compared to away. A similar pattern is observed for xA (expected assists), further emphasizing the advantage of playing in a familiar home stadium. This trend suggests that the home atmosphere plays a significant role in a team’s performance. Teams with a higher xG and xA at home might benefit from the psychological and tactical advantages of playing in their own stadium. These statistics can be valuable for assessing a team’s overall strength, as well as identifying potential weaknesses or inconsistencies in their away form. By analyzing this data, coaches, analysts, and fans can better understand how home and away factors influence team performance throughout the season.",

    "text": "3.9 Winner Winner Chicken Dinner: Analysing Team Wins against Oppositions\nHere each team’s performance has been analysed by assessing how well the team capatilized on their expected goals against the respective opposition’s expected goals.

Points on the line y = x (where the xG scored by both teams are equal) should be yellow, reflecting a draw. Points below the line y = x (where the opposition has more xG) should be red, representing a loss.\nAny deviation from this expected trend suggests that either the team or the opposition failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities. For example, a red point above the line y = x indicates that despite having more scoring chances (more xG), the team lost the match. This might reflect missed opportunities or an inability to convert chances effectively.\nOn the other hand, a green point above the line y = x indicates strong performance, where the team not only had more scoring chances but also capitalized on them effectively, leading to a win. Teams like Arsenal, Leicester City, and Tottenham Hotspur, which have numerous green points above y = x , demonstrate good performance by converting their opportunities into victories.\nConversely, teams like Aston Villa and Norwich City show a different trend, with more red points below the line y = x . This suggests that although they might have had opportunities, they either failed to capitalize on them or could not prevent the opposition from scoring, resulting in a poor performance. Such teams may need to focus on improving both their attacking efficiency and defensive resilience.",

Higher-scoring and higher-xG teams often rank near the top on avg_shots, indicating that goal and xG performance tends to align with shooting frequency. In other words, the more shots the team attempt, the better chances they have to score a goal.\nThe similar trend can be observed among teams that do well in terms of assists (avg_assists) and key passes (avg_key_passes), as they typically align with higher xG and goals. Some lines show teams whose expected numbers (xG, xA) are decent, but their actual goals or assists are relatively lower. This mismatch may indicate inefficiencies in finishing or an inability to translate creative build-up into final outputs. Conversely, a few teams might outperform their expected numbers, suggesting clinical finishing or overperformance relative to their underlying metrics.\nTeams located in the upper region of the parallel coordinates plot are performing better than those in the lower region. For example, Burnley and Aston Villa appear to be struggling, as they are positioned much lower compared to the other teams. On the other hand, teams like Arsenal, Liverpool, and Leicester City are performing well, as they are placed higher on the plot. Overall, the graph hints at strong interdependencies where higher goals/ assists positively correlates with xG, xA and shots, key passes.",

This suggests that Leicester City has consistently performed well, achieving a balanced mix of wins and draws, which is a strong indicator of their competitiveness and ability to maintain good form over time. Achieving 2 points per game is typically a hallmark of top teams in any league, putting Leicester City in an elite position relative to the others.\nOn the other hand, Aston Villa appears at the bottom of the chart, with an average of less than 0.5 points per game. This places them among the least successful teams, indicating that Aston Villa struggles to accumulate points, likely due to a higher frequency of losses and fewer draws or wins.
