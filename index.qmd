# Introduction

Soccer is the most popular sport globally, with over 2 billion viewers tuning in to the FIFA World Cup Final 2022. Recently, the game has been transformed by the integration of data analytics, reshaping how teams approach strategy. Soccer managers now rely heavily on data analysis to make critical decisions, such as selecting the starting lineup, identifying transfer market targets, and determining in-game substitutions. Additionally, extensive datasets of soccer matches are readily available, enabling deeper insights into the sport.

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of soccer performance, focusing on key factors and questions that impact outcomes at both the player and team levels. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights by exploring various dynamics within the data.

Our analysis will examine player performance across consecutive matches, evaluating how individuals sustain or adapt their performance over time while identifying patterns of consistency or decline. Beyond individual performance, we will assess overall team performance, comparing actual outcomes with expected performance to pinpoint teams that are overachieving or underperforming.

Key elements of the study include analyzing how passing accuracy and assist patterns influence team success, investigating the advantages of playing at home, and assessing the impact of starting lineups and in-game substitutions on match results. The findings will be presented through detailed charts and metrics, offering a clear framework for building the ultimate team.

By utilizing data-driven techniques, this project seeks to deliver valuable insights that can help teams optimize their strategies and give fans a deeper understanding of the elements driving success on the soccer field.
